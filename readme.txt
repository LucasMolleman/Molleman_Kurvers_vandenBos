These files contain the data and code for "Unleashing the BEAST - a brief measure of human social information use" by Lucas Molleman, Ralf H.J.M. Kurvers and Wouter van den Bos; Evolution and Human Behaviour (2019).

This folder contains the following documents:

- Excel file "Data set.xlsx" with 3 tabs: Experiment 1, Experiment 2, and a legend explaining the variables.
- Two txt files, respectively containing the data for Experiment 1 "data_waves123.txt" and the data for Experiment 2 "data_tasks123.txt".
- The R file "Analysis.r" reads in these two txt files and performs the analyses reported in the paper.
- A .zip file containing the code for the experimental task (developed in LIONESS Lab; see lioness-lab.org), including instructions to get it running for your own purposes.

For the R file, it is assumed that the following packages are installed: 'lme4', 'visreg' and 'rptR'.
For editing the experimental screens (e.g. to tailor the BEAST for your own purposes) we recommend using LIONESS Lab, which provides a user-friendly way to do this.

If you have any questions or issues running the code, please do not hesitate to contact us via: l.s.molleman@uva.nl or lucasmolleman@gmail.com
